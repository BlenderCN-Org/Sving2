Sving2
=====

Sving2 is a Python plugin for Blender3d 2.5 that allows the exporting of Second Life Sculpted Prims.

It is feature/maintenance fork of the previously GPL'd [Primstar 2] (http://dominodesigns.info/node/331).

The goal is to provide an Internet accessible repository of the last available GPL'd version of Primstar 2. 
Any new patches merged here will NOT be forwarded upstream. This is the price of Free Software.
Any patches submitted will be reviewed and merged in.

Sving is not affiliated with the Machinimatrix or Primstar teams.
